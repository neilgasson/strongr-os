# Strongr OS

Strongr OS is the governed operating platform for the Strongr Society ecosystem.

It will provide the shared foundation for:

- Strongr Studio
- Strongr Daily 2.0
- Strongr Library
- Strongr Trust
- Strongr Flow
- Strongr Guide
- Strongr Insights
- Future Strongr Society products

## Current phase

**M0 — Governed Platform Kernel**

The immediate purpose of M0 is to establish secure, recoverable, version-controlled foundations before M1 feature implementation begins.

## Current implementation boundary

The current Strongr Daily application must remain unchanged during the parallel Strongr OS build.

The existing Strongr Studio and M1 checkpoints are design and workflow references only. They are not the production foundation.

## Governing rules

- GitHub is the source of truth for code, migrations, contracts, prompts, tests, decisions, and runbooks.
- Supabase/PostgreSQL is the canonical runtime data foundation.
- AI may assist with drafting and checks; authorized humans retain theological, editorial, approval, export, and publishing authority.
- Tenant isolation, authorization, auditability, accessibility, recovery, and privacy are release requirements.
- No database migration is executed before it is reviewed and committed.
- No M1 implementation continues until the M0 acceptance requirements are met.
